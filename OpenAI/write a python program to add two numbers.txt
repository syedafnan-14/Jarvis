OpenAI response for prompt: jarvis using artificial intelligence write a python program to add two numbers
 ********************



# This program demonstrates an AI-powered program to add two numbers 

# Importing the required libraries 
import numpy as np 
import tensorflow as tf

# Defining the two numbers 
num1 = 5 
num2 = 10

# Creating a neural network for the program
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_dim = 1, activation = 'relu'), tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])

# Compiling the model
model.compile(loss = 'mean_squared_error', optimizer = 'sgd')

# Fitting the model 
model.fit([num1], [num2], epochs = 200)

# Evaluating the model 
addition = model.evaluate([num1], [num2])

# Printing the result 
print('The sum of ', num1, ' and ', num2, ' is: ', addition)
